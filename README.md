# USU FSLC Website

This is an early proposal for the website. Feel free to be critical!

I'm waiting to post the server code, mainly because it's not ready. I could have just done it with some starter code from WebStorm or something, but I really want to know what's going on down in the weeds. I'll have it up as soon as it's functional at the most basic level.

## Proposals

The first image is how the index.html will render. The second image is with the commented out spots uncommented and the following lines commented. Also with a few tweaks to the css.
